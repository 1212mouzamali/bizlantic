            <p className='about-vision'>100% Foreign Ownership:</p>
            <p className='about-team'>Previously, foreign investors needed a local Emirati sponsor to own a business in the mainland. However, recent reforms allow full ownership in many sectors, giving entrepreneurs complete control over their company, decision-making, and profits. This makes Dubai a highly attractive destination for global investors and startups.
